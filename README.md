# Tetris For SSH
I made this at 3AM because I was bored. \
Enjoy!

Needs ed25519 for authentication because yes

Too lazy to include the MIT license but it's under that, yeah...

SSH into this if you want to play. Please be nice, there is obviously DDOS protection in the code.
Demo server doesn't save data, so if I ever restart it everything will be gone. Sorry not sorry!
```shell
ssh -p 17419 -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 player@tetris.superdev.one
```
